# Why?

As we all know, the native documentation for some of the popular libraries are truly dogshit, so using my full brain compacity i thought it'd be cool to contribute to humanity by creating a treasure trove of valuable documentations that i come across. 

it's mostly for my own viewing but maybe you could find some stuff inside that suits your liking, idk
